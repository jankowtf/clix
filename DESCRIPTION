Description: A custom CLI implementation with features for common CLI scenarios
    such as "ask user if a non-existing directory should be created or not". 
    It tries to provide sensible bundles of
    a) messages (in the broader sense)
    b) querying for user input and 
    c) executing the implications of a given user input
